# ChatBotFramework
The chatbot framework is an independent and self-contained framework gives accurate answers in a minimal amount of time. 
This framework lets the user give a specified set of questions to the Bot. The way these questions that are handled by the bot
is documented and the performance of the Bot is checked. 

This framework works in 2 ways. The user can either specify questions in the XLSS format or in a key-value json format.
Either way, this framework tests the Bot and records the answers given by the same in an accurate manner.
